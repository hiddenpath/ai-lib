# AI-lib: A Unified AI SDK for Rust
> **Note**: This is a placeholder for the ai-lib project.

## Overview

**ai-lib** is an upcoming, unified AI SDK for Rust. Its goal is to provide a single, consistent interface for interacting with a wide range of large language models from different providers, including:

- OpenAI
- Groq
- Google Gemini
- And others

## Project Status

The project is currently under **active development**. Our core mission is to abstract away the differences in:

- API endpoints
- Authentication methods
- Data structures

This allows developers to switch between AI models with minimal code changes.

For now, this crate serves as a placeholder to secure the name on crates.io.

## Interested in the project?

The foundation of this SDK is currently being built on top of our existing work on the **groqai** crate. You can explore our initial progress and code there:

We appreciate your patience and look forward to releasing the first functional version of **ai-lib** soon.
